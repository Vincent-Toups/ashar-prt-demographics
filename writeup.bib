abstract = {Summary
Low back pain is a very common symptom. It occurs in high-income, middle-income, and low-income countries and all age groups from children to the elderly population. Globally, years lived with disability caused by low back pain increased by 54% between 1990 and 2015, mainly because of population increase and ageing, with the biggest increase seen in low-income and middle-income countries. Low back pain is now the leading cause of disability worldwide. For nearly all people with low back pain, it is not possible to identify a specific nociceptive cause. Only a small proportion of people have a well understood pathological cause—eg, a vertebral fracture, malignancy, or infection. People with physically demanding jobs, physical and mental comorbidities, smokers, and obese individuals are at greatest risk of reporting low back pain. Disabling low back pain is over-represented among people with low socioeconomic status. Most people with new episodes of low back pain recover quickly; however, recurrence is common and in a small proportion of people, low back pain becomes persistent and disabling. Initial high pain intensity, psychological distress, and accompanying pain at multiple body sites increases the risk of persistent disabling low back pain. Increasing evidence shows that central pain-modulating mechanisms and pain cognitions have important roles in the development of persistent disabling low back pain. Cost, health-care use, and disability from low back pain vary substantially between countries and are influenced by local culture and social systems, as well as by beliefs about cause and effect. Disability and costs attributed to low back pain are projected to increase in coming decades, in particular in low-income and middle-income countries, where health and other systems are often fragile and not equipped to cope with this growing burden. Intensified research efforts and global initiatives are clearly needed to address the burden of low back pain as a public health problem.}

abstract={The opioid epidemic, with its noticeable increase in opioid prescriptions and related misuse, abuse and resultant deaths in the previous 12 years, is a particularly North American phenomenon. Europe, and particularly low- and middle-income countries, appear to be less influenced by this problem.   There is undisputable value in using opioids not only in the treatment of acute pain, but in cancer pain as well. However, opioids are progressively being prescribed more and more for chronic non-cancer pain, despite inadequate data on their efficacy. In this paper, we describe the current prevalence of opioid misuse in a number of countries and the rationale for the commencement of opioid therapy. The safe initiation and monitoring of opioid therapy as well as the need for concurrent use of interdisciplinary multimodal therapy is discussed. The possible consequences of long-term use and predictors of high opioid use and overdose are presented. In particular, the management of opioid use disorders and the prevention of opioid abuse and dependence in the young, the old and the pregnant are discussed. Measures to prevent overprescribing and to alleviate risk are described, including the tapering of opioids and the use of opioid deterrents. Finally, the paper looks at the future development of pioneering medications and technologies to potentially treat abuse. In those parts of the world with an opioid epidemic, coroners and medical examiners, private and public health agencies, and agencies that enforce the law need to cooperate in an effort to slow down and reverse the indiscriminate use of prescribing opioids in the long-term for chronic non-cancer pain. Ongoing research is needed to create ways to minimise risks of opioid use, and to provide evidence for effective strategies for treating chronic pain.},
