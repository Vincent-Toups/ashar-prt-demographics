Codebook Additional Notes

PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES.CSV:
Timepoints:
- eligibility_assess_arm_1: eligibility/consent session
- t1_arm_1: pre-treatment fMRI session
- baseline: average of eligibility/consent session and pre-treatment fMRI session
- t2_arm_1: post-treatment fMRI session
- X_month_follow_up_arm_1: follow up timepoint, X months after the post-treatment fMRI session

Group:
- 1 = PRT
- 2 = Placebo
- 3 = No treatment

- Pain_avg: 1-week average pain intensity
- bpi_intensity: mean of the four 1-week average pain intensity items on the BPI-SF (best, worst, avg, now)
- Alcohol, opioid, and cannabis: timeline follow back method, number of units consumed for the 2 weeks prior.

- For other items and additional information: see Codebook.pdf

EVOKED PAIN MAP NOTES:
- values are beta weights (parameter estimates) from regression, representing voxel's relationship to evoked pain report

EVOKED PAIN METADATA NOTES:
- For the pain ratings, the VAS was randomly initialized to either 15 or 85 / 100 on each trial, so pain ratings of exactly 15 or 85 *may* indicate missing data
- time: 1 = t1_arm_1 (pre-tx fMRI), 2 = t2_arm_1 (post-tx fMRI)

SEED CONN MAP NOTES:
- values are Pearson correlation coefficients, representing voxel's correlation with mean signal from the seed region
- For the pain ratings, the VAS was randomly initialized to either 15 or 85 / 100 on each trial, so pain ratings of exactly 15 or 85 *may* indicate missing data

SEED CONN METADATA NOTES:
- median_corr_gt3SDs: Flag indicating whether the median correlation value in the image is greater than 3 standard deviations from the group mean
- spatial_std_gt3SDs: Flag indicating whether the spatial standard deviation of the image is greater than 3 standard deviations from the group mean
- time: 1 = t1_arm_1 (pre-tx fMRI), 2 = t2_arm_1 (post-tx fMRI)
