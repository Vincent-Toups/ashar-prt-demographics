Mind-body treatments for chronic back pain
Investigator: Dr. Tor D. Wager, CU Boulder

descriptive

Thank you for your interest in this study. Before
you come in to learn more about the study, it
would be helpful to see if you are likely to
qualify to be in the study. In order to do this, we
would like to ask you some eligibility questions,
which will include questions about your back
pain, mental health history, medical history, and
more. It should take about 15 minutes to go
through these questions.
We invite you to take part in a research study
because you su er from chronic back pain. The
purpose of this study is to test the e cacy of a
novel mind-body treatment for back pain. In
this study, we want to understand how this
treatment relieves pain by scanning your brain
using functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI). In addition to the fMRI measurements,
we will collect blood draws from you, and
collect electroencephalography (EEG) measures
of brain activity. Both fMRI and EEG are widely
used, safe, non-invasive measures of brain
activity.
During the fMRI session you will be asked to

11/25/2018 4:48pm

perform a set of tasks. These include 1)
pressure stimulations applied to your ngernail
that will be tolerably painful, 2) listening to
unpleasant sounds, and 3) providing ratings of
your ongoing back pain. During the MRI scan,
we may place you in a somewhat
uncomfortable position (i.e., a mild back
extension) to elicit back pain of moderate
intensity.
You will be randomized into one of two groups,
like ipping a coin. One group will receive the
treatment as soon as possible after the rst
assessment session; the other group (a "waitlist" group) will be o ered a treatment about 4
weeks after the rst assessment session. Both
groups will be asked to not pursue any other
treatments in the 4 week period between the
assessment sessions.
The study involves an eligibility assessment
session, a baseline MRI session, receiving the
treatment, and then, about 4 weeks later, a
post-treatment MRI session. EEG will be
collected at the eligibility session.
During the course of this study, we ask you to
continue your normal treatment schedule and
not to add, stop, or change any treatmentrelated activities unless determined as
necessary by your physician. This is important
to help us compare changes in the treatment
group to changes in the wait-list group.
Payment will be around $225 for completing
the study.
The questions below will assess your eligibility
for the study and will take about 15 minutes to
complete. All the information you provide will
be kept con dential and only accessible to
members of the research team. If you are
eligible, we will call you to provide further
details about the study and see whether you'd
like to participate.
We are also required to give you the number of
University of Colorado Boulder IRB, the Ethics
Board that oversees our research, in case you
have questions or concerns for them: it is (303)
735-3702. The IRB is not be able to answer
speci c questions about study participation. If
you have questions about study participation,
you may email canlab@colorado.edu with your
questions or with your phone number and a
team member will give you a call. If you

complete the questions below, a study member
will be in touch with you shortly regarding your
eligibility and to provide more information
about the study.
